## Key Features

- **Task Management:** Effortlessly add, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks can be marked as completed or pending, providing a clear view of your progress.
- **Editable Task Titles:** Switch between view and edit modes to update task titles directly in the interface.
- **Completion Toggle:** Use checkboxes to mark tasks as completed, with a visual distinction for completed tasks.

- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Context API

The Context API is used in TaskMaster to manage and provide the state of tasks across the application. By creating a central `TodoContext`, the application can:

- **Global State Management:** Share task-related data (e.g., task list, update, and delete functions) throughout the component tree without prop drilling.
- **Consistent State Updates:** Ensure that any updates to tasks are reflected immediately across all components that consume the context.
- **Simplified Component Structure:** Maintain a cleaner and more manageable component hierarchy by avoiding excessive prop passing.

## LocalStorage

LocalStorage is utilized in TaskMaster to enhance the user experience by:

- **Persistent Data Storage:** Save tasks and their completion statuses across browser sessions. This ensures that user data remains available even after refreshing or closing the application.
- **Offline Access:** Allow users to access their tasks without an internet connection by storing data locally in the browser.
- **Data Retrieval:** Load saved tasks from LocalStorage when the application starts, providing a seamless experience with previously entered data.
